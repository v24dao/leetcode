This is a repository containing some of my solutions for LeetCode problems.

I am mainly working through the [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/oizxjoit/) and [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode150).

Resources that I would recommend include:

-   The [Coding Interview Patterns](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/my-new-book-coding-interview-patterns) book by ByteByteGo
-   The [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) website and [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/neetcode)
